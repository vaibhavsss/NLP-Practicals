## Introduction

The **NLP-Practicals** repository aims to provide practical solutions to various **Natural Language Processing** tasks. The exercises are implemented using **Python 3.12.4** and make use of the latest Python libraries designed for NLP. This repository is perfect for beginners and intermediate practitioners who wish to understand and apply NLP concepts through hands-on coding.

## Practical Overview

This repository contains 10 practicals that cover the core concepts of NLP, including text preprocessing, tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, text summarization, and more.

### List of Practicals:

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   Tokenization, removing stopwords, lemmatization, and other text preprocessing tasks.
   
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   Using spaCy to identify and classify named entities (persons, locations, organizations).
   
3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**  
   Identifying the grammatical category of each word in a sentence.
   
4. **Word2Vec**  
   Finding similar words to a given word using **gensim**'s Word2Vec model.
   
5. **Topic Modeling**  
   Extracting key topics from a set of documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
   
6. **Text Classification**  
   Classifying text into predefined categories (e.g., sentiment analysis).
   
7. **Text Summarization**  
   Generating concise summaries of long articles using transformer models (e.g., BART).
   
8. **Chatbot Development**  
   Building a basic rule-based chatbot that can respond to user inputs.
   
9. **Language Translation**  
   Translating text between different languages using pre-trained translation models.
   
10. **Text Generation**  
    Generating human-like text using pre-trained models like GPT-2.

## Technologies Used

This repository uses the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python 3.12.4**: The scripts in this repository are written in **Python 3.12.4**, which provides improved performance, compatibility, and features for modern Python applications.
  
- **NLP Libraries**:
  - **spaCy**: For tokenization, POS tagging, NER, and other NLP tasks.
  - **gensim**: For word embedding models (e.g., Word2Vec) and topic modeling (LDA).
  - **transformers**: For leveraging transformer models like BART and GPT-2 for tasks like text summarization and text generation.
  - **nltk**: For basic text processing tasks like stopword removal, tokenization, and more.
  
- **PyTorch**: Used for model training and inference, especially for tasks involving deep learning-based models.
